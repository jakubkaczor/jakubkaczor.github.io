<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
  on my personal website! This project is experimental. I&rsquo;m not sure about
  its destiny. For now I will be using it to share public information about me,
  such as contact information, platforms you can find me on, etc. It is possible
  I will be experimenting with blogging, so you can subscribe to my feed
  <a href="/feed.xml">here</a>.

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>
  My loved one has told me that this website looked &ldquo;raw&rdquo;. Just like
  I had been too lazy to do it. Firstly, I was surprised. To my eyes it has
  never looked like this. Only later I understood that it may seem like this
  indeed. Perhaps at first I&rsquo;d thought differently, because one of my the
  most visited sites is
  <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>

<p>
  This website &ndash; as Wikipedia, I believe &ndash; is designed to be
  informational with simplicity in mind. I wanted it to be
</p>
<ul>
  <li>easy to maintain,</li>
  <li>content focused,</li>
  <li>informational,</li>
  <li>responsive,</li>
  <li>loading fast.</li>
</ul>
