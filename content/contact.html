<h1>The list</h1>
<p>
  In case you need to quickly contact me, here is the list of the ways you can
  do this ordered by my preference descending. You will find rationale behind
  this order below.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    ðŸ“§&nbsp;E&hyphen;mail:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jakub@jakubkaczor.com"
      >jakub@jakubkaczor.com</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>Signal&nbsp;<strong>CALL</strong></li>
  <li>Cell&nbsp;phone&nbsp;call</li>
  <li>Signal&nbsp;message</li>
  <li>SMS</li>
</ol>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>
  I would like to stress that I assume discussed forms of communication are used
  in the most common manner. You could use e&hyphen;mail for
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">IM</a> &ndash;
  although not that instant &ndash; but the way these services are constructed
  inclines you to specified use.
</p>

<p>
  The most optimal form of electronic communication for me is the one that
  let&rsquo;s you exchange the most information, with the least of your
  resources consumed. E&hyphen;mail throughout all these years seems to be a
  champion within this regard. Let&rsquo;s have a look at how a typical process
  of communication looks like from a perspective of one person:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a message and send it.</li>
  <li>Wait.</li>
  <li>Read the reply and process it, then reply.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Of course sitting in front of the computer and waiting for an answer is
  pointless, and most of us will be doing something else in the time of waiting.
  It would seem that then e&hyphen;mailing or IM wouldn&rsquo;t differ as much,
  and IM would be even superior, because in some way it is more
  &ldquo;instant&rdquo;. Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t switch between tasks as
  efficiently as computers do. Therefore not negligible amount of resources is
  wasted while IM. A human&hyphen;relevant version of communication process
  would look like this:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a message and send it.</li>
  <li>Switch the task.</li>
  <li>Do something else.</li>
  <li>Switch the task.</li>
  <li>Read the reply and process it, then reply.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Moving from writing a message to sending it, and from reading to replying
  isn&rsquo;t as costly, so it won&rsquo;t be considered. It is clear that in
  case of IM these task switches are more frequent. Writing and reading is
  scalable, so doing it less frequently will result in doing it in longer
  stints, assuming we want to communicate the same amount of information. You
  could argue that a call is equivalent of reading and writing at the same time.
  You can speak and I can listen simultaneously, saving it. That is true, thus
  it is higher in the list than IM. It has one disadvantage though. It is highly
  disruptive. Unlike receiving e&hyphen;mail, receiving a call will interrupt
  the process you are currently involved in. Often times for the gain of
  nothing. (&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak right now, I&rsquo;ll call you
  back.&rdquo;) Reading and replying to e&hyphen;mail can be scheduled, planned
  to be done in the most optimal time. Of course you can also schedule calls,
  but you don&rsquo;t have the same independence and freedom as it involves the
  other party.
</p>

<p>
  I have chosen Signal equivalents of calling and texting as prior just because
  they are more private and secure. You can read more about Signal
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)">here</a>, install it
  <a href="https://www.signal.org/download/">there</a>, and donate to it

<p>
  I had so far neglected one aspect of communication, which is conveying
  emotions, and other non&hyphen;verbal signals. Textual communication is
  terrible at this. To enhance this, I suggest extensive use of emojis. ðŸ˜‰ Calls
  are better in this scenario, because they preserve the tone of voice. Despite
  this, I would never use these methods when non&hyphen;verbal signals are
  important. Face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face meeting is my choice here. I believe
  video calls would do, but I don&rsquo;t have experience with them.
